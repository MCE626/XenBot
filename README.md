# XenBot
Xendric's Discord bot. Woo. Uptime of this bot is like 10% lol. Invite bot to your server: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=335623887247114240&scope=bot&permissions=1341652179

Or join the bot testing discord to see what it's like before adding! https://discord.gg/cKVHVDX

XenBot is a bot made by Xendric Interactive, more specifically by the lead programmer *MCE626*. The bot is for getting user profile stats from Xendric's games (When the time comes).

For now, it's just a basic random bot as MCE626 learns more javascript and coding a discord bot. This bot is coded with Discord.js and Discord.js-commando in JavaScript.

The prefix for this bot is "x//". You can also tag the bot and do a command without the "x//".

Example: x//timein 1 30 2 5

## Todo list:
- Music commands
- Get profile stats from Xendric Interactive games (When the time comes)
- Maybe more ~~fun~~ random things?
