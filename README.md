XenBot is a bot made by Xendric Interactive, more specifically by the lead programmer *MCE626*. The bot is for getting user profile stats from Xendric's games (When the time comes).

For now, it's just a basic random bot as MCE626 learns more javascript and coding a discord bot. This bot is coded with Discord.js and Discord.js-commando in JavaScript.

The prefix for this bot is "x//"

Example: x//roll
