XenBot is a bot made by Xendric Interactive, more specifically by the lead programmer *MCE626*. The bot is for getting user profile stats from Xendric's games (When the time comes).

For now, it's just a basic random bot as MCE626 learns more javascript and coding a discord bot. This bot is coded with Discord.js and Discord.js-commando in JavaScript.

The prefix for this bot is `x//`. You can also tag the bot and do a command without the `x//`.

Examples:
- x//user MCE626
- @XenBot user MCE626

## Todo list:
- Get profile stats from Xendric Interactive games (When the time comes)
- Maybe more ~~fun~~ random things?
